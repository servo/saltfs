# Servo's SaltStack Configuration

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/servo/saltfs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/servo/saltfs)

## What's going on?

Salt is a configuration management tool that we use to automate Servo's
infrastructure. See [the tutorials](http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/tutorials/) to get started.

## Contributing

There are guides available on [the servo wiki](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Buildbot-administration).
If you see a way that these configurations could be improved, or try to set up
your own instance and run into trouble, file [an issue](https://github.com/servo/saltfs/issues/new)!

## Travis

TravisCI is set up to test all configurations.
