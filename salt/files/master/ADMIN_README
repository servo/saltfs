Note: this directory is meant to be used to TEMPORARILY test out changes
to our Salt configurations on the live builders.

To get started, clone the saltfs repo using the `setup.sh` script.
Make any changes you want inside the `saltfs` directory.
When you're done, make sure to run the `cleanup.sh` script.

This folder takes precedence over gitfs
(which reads file from the master branch of the saltfs repository),
so it is important to follow a few guidelines:

- Avoid using this folder if possible: prefer to test changes locally
  using the steps under "Salt workflow" in the `docs/salt.md` file.

- If you do need to use this folder, use it only as long as you need it,
  and make sure to run the `cleanup.sh` script afterwards.
  Any files that are left dangling will continue to mask changes
  in the real saltfs repository.

- There is only one of these folders, so if it's already in use,
  wait until it is empty again before testing your change.
