Note: this directory is meant to be used to TEMPORARILY test out changes to our
Salt configurations on the live builders. This folder takes precedence over
gitfs (which reads file from the master branch of the saltfs repository), so it
is important to follow a few guidelines to avoid problems:

- Avoid using this folder if possible: prefer to test changes locally using the
steps under "Making changes" at
https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Buildbot-administration

- If you do need to use this folder, use it only as long as you need it, and
make sure to empty it afterwards (except for this file). Any files that are
left dangling will continue to mask changes in the real saltfs repository.

- There is only one of these folders, so if it's already in use, wait until it
is empty again before testing your change.
