Note: this directory is meant to be used to TEMPORARILY test out changes to our
Salt configurations on the live builders. To use it, clone the saltfs repo into
this folder, and Salt will read from it (/tmp/salt-testing-root/saltfs).
This folder takes precedence over gitfs (which reads file from the master
branch of the saltfs repository), so it is important to follow a few guidelines:

- Avoid using this folder if possible: prefer to test changes locally using the
steps under "Making changes" at
https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Buildbot-administration

- If you do need to use this folder, use it only as long as you need it, and
make sure to remove the cloned saltfs folder afterwards. Any files that are
left dangling will continue to mask changes in the real saltfs repository.

- There is only one of these folders, so if it's already in use, wait until it
is empty again before testing your change.
